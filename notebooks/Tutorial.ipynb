    "# Proxy widgets tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial attempts to introduce proxy widgets and to explain their usage and major features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proxy widget mechanism is intended to make it easy to introduce Javascript based visualizations\n",
    "and other functionality into a Jupyter notebook.   Proxy widgets support easily configurable\n",
    "two way communication between Javascript components and Python components running in an IPython\n",
    "kernel process.  Proxy widgets may be used to exploit thousands of useful Javascript libraries\n",
    "and visualizations in Jupyter notebooks with relatively little effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proxy widgets may be combined with other widget implementations to provide dynamic\n",
    "and interactive methods for viewing and interacting with complex data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial organization\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial follows this general outline\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preliminary comments,\n",
    "- Basic usage.\n",
    "- Teaser motivational examples, not explained in detail,\n",
    "- Detailed feature discussion with simpler examples,\n",
    "- Discussion of proxy widget limitations and security restrictions,\n",
    "- Examples of debugging aids for developing proxy widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Preliminary comments: How and Who\n",
    "\n",
    "## Please note: the tutorial should be run interactively, one cell at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial does not support \"offline\" or \"preview\" mode (as discussed below) and you will\n",
    "see surprising results if you use \"run all\" to run all the cells at once due to the asynchronous\n",
    "nature of Javascript/IPython communication (also discussed below).  Please run each\n",
    "cell of the tutorial independently, one at a time in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites: Who is this tutorial written for?\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop non-trivial IPython widgets of any kind the reader will need to know\n",
    "something about Python, Jupyter, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.  It also wouldn't\n",
    "hurt to have some familiarity with common Javascript libraries such a jQuery and\n",
    "`require.js`.  The following discussion assumes the reader has some\n",
    "familiarity with these prerequisite topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Proxy widgets are generally used like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load some javascript functionality once.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then any number of times:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a proxy widget.\n",
    "- Attach javascript functionality to the widget\n",
    "- Interact with the widget from Python or from the browser Javascript interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples in this section we will load an audio spectrogram player\n",
    "implemented in Javasscript and use the player implementations in some\n",
    "proxy widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic usage step 1: Load some javascript functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "To load javascript functionality execute some code files either directly\n",
    "(as shown below) or using a loader like `require.js` (as demonstrated further down in the tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the next cell loads the <a href=\"https://wavesurfer-js.org/docs/\">wavesurfer.js</a>\n",

    "- Proxy widgets are focused around the jQuery `element` associated to the widget.\n",
    "- Proxy widgets allow Python to call-in to Javascript.\n",

    "- Python/Javascript interactions for widgets (including proxy widgets) are asynchronous.\n",
    "- Proxy widgets allow Python to send JSON compatible data to Javascript (with extensions).\n",

    "- The order of execution between cells and javascript fragments can be confusing.\n",
